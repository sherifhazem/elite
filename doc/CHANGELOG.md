# ❗ Mandatory Rules for Writing Changelog Entries

Any time an AI agent or developer modifies the project, they must:

### ✔ 1. Add a new entry under the correct version  
### ✔ 2. Write short, clear bullet points  
### ✔ 3. Mention affected modules/files  
### ✔ 4. Document structural changes precisely  
### ✔ 5. Reference documentation updates (if done)  
### ✔ 6. Never skip adding an entry  
### ✔ 7. Never modify an older entry
